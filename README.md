# Welcome to the Bowling game!

## Getting started

Since this app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
you will need to have `node` installed with a version `>=6`.
To install the necessary dependencies, issue the command `npm install` after cloning the repo.

To start a development server, just type `npm start`. A browser window will open at `http://localhost:3000`
and you can play around with the app.

You can run the test suite by running `npm test`.
